🔭 I’m currently working on Interactive Data Visualization (Vis) and Visual Analytics using D3.js.

🌱 I’m currently learning to build a template for event detection mechanisms in visualizing time-series data.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary research and methodology in Vis.

💬 Ask me about web-based interactive visualization. It's so fun to work with!
