### Hi there, I'm [Huyen](https://myweb.ttu.edu/huyenngu/) 👋

<!--
**huyen-nguyen/huyen-nguyen** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->



🔭 I’m currently working on **Interactive Data Visualization** (Vis) and **Visual Analytics** using D3.js for web-based visualizations, supporting the understanding and insight discovery of quantitative and qualitative data.

🌱 I’m currently learning to build a *cross-domain template* for **event detection mechanisms** in time-series data visualization.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary research and methodology in Vis.
