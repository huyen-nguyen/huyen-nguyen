### Hi there, I'm [Huyen](https://huyennguyen.com) 👋

<!--
**huyen-nguyen/huyen-nguyen** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->



🌱 I’m a Research Fellow in Biomedical Informatics @ Harvard Medical School. 

🎯 My work involves developing visualization systems to help scientists efficiently explore and interact with genomics and nucleomics data, supporting sense-making and decision-making in the biomedical domain.

🍁 When I don't visualize things, I often read and play the ukulele.
